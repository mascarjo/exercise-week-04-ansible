## Exercise 2 - Ansible Playbooks

The files in this repo include exercise-playbook.yaml and hosts.yaml. These two files work in conjuction to complete the assigned tasks. The exercise-playbook.yaml contains all of the individual playbook tasks combined into one file to allow for each task to be run consecutively. The exercise-playbook yaml calls the hosts.yaml file in order to create matches with the two routers listed under the [cisco] grouping. The IP address match allows ansible to connect to the routers in question and apply the playbook. 

To ease some of the automating requirements, I've set some variables such as 'private_ip' to contain that router's vmnet10 address so that these interfaces could be configured. The management interfaces were first given IP addresses via DHCP before statically assigning them.
